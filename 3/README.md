# Challenge 1

```
Create a generator function that can be used to iterate over all of the file names in a given directory. 

It should yield the next file name.

It should recursively iterate over all files in nested directories.

The file name should be the full path to the file.

Call the function and iterate over the files in a directory of your choice.
```

`node 1.mjs .`

* How does a generator work?
* When would we use generators?
